### Hello! I'm Chitra 🥳

👩🏽‍💻 I like to solve problems in epidemiology, public health, and climate change with the use of statistics and software. I'm currently working on modelling [malaria vaccine](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/q-a-on-rts-s-malaria-vaccine) rollouts and [mortality patterns in children under the age of five](https://champshealth.org/). I've previously worked on [childhood malnutrition](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=_FXal5cAAAAJ&citation_for_view=_FXal5cAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C), 
[climate change impacts](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=_FXal5cAAAAJ&citation_for_view=_FXal5cAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC), [dynamics of disease spread](https://github.com/idem-lab/conmat), and various clinical trials.

Talk to me about statistical analyses, orchestrating analysis pipelines, and high performance computing. I also love chatting about open research, better software principles, research translation, and public health issues. You can also ask me anything about baking, playing the piano, yoga, and Copperplate calligraphy. If you'd like to contact me, best e-mail me at my The Kids email address.
