### Hello! I'm Chitra 🥳

👩🏽‍💻 I like to solve public health and climate change problems using maths, stats, and computers. I'm currently working on modelling [malaria vaccine impact](https://www.vaccineimpact.org/) and [mortality patterns in children](https://champshealth.org/). I've previously worked on [childhood malnutrition](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=_FXal5cAAAAJ&citation_for_view=_FXal5cAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C), 
[climate change impacts](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=_FXal5cAAAAJ&citation_for_view=_FXal5cAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC), [dynamics of disease spread](https://github.com/idem-lab/conmat), and various clinical trials.

💬 Talk to me about statistical analyses, orchestrating analysis pipelines, and high performance computing. I also love chatting about open research, better software principles, research translation, and public health issues. 

✨ Also talk to me about baking, playing the piano, strength training, and Copperplate calligraphy.

📨 If you'd like to contact me, best e-mail me at my The Kids email address.
