### Hello! I'm Chitra 😃

- 👩🏽‍💻 I like to solve problems in epidemiology, public health, and climate change with the use of statistics and software dev.
- 🤔 I'm currently working on modelling [malaria vaccine](https://www.who.int/news-room/questions-and-answers/item/q-a-on-rts-s-malaria-vaccine) rollouts and the [dynamics of disease spread](https://github.com/idem-lab/conmat).
- 🧐 I've previously worked on [childhood malnutrition](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=_FXal5cAAAAJ&citation_for_view=_FXal5cAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C), 
[climate change impacts](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=_FXal5cAAAAJ&citation_for_view=_FXal5cAAAAJ:Tyk-4Ss8FVUC), and various clinical trials.
- 🖥️ I'm comfortable with R, Git, and SQL. I can use Stata and SAS as well, but I prefer not to.
- 📝 I'm studying Bash, high performance computing, and more generally: how to become a better statistical programmer and software developer.
- 🌱 Talk to me about open research, better software principles, research translation, and public health issues.
- 💬 More generally, ask me anything about baking, yoga, and calligraphy.
