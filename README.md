### Hello! I'm Chitra 😃

👩‍🔬 I've worked on issues in childhood malnutrition, climate change, and management of clinical trials as a medical statistician.

🌱 I'm currently learning software development and how to be a better statistical programmer.

💻 I mainly use R but am also learning C and Python.
